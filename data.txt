The primary reason supporting my stance is that a large proportion of individuals are not aware of the importance of conserving wild animals.
It is a fact that many people, be they young or old, have not been taught the knowledge about the protection of wild animals, being unfamiliar with the ways in which the extinction of wildlife will adversely influence the ecosystem and human life.
Also, although news reports focus on a range of topics, including politics and the economy, wildlife preservation is always excluded.
